## üó∫Ô∏è Learning Path (8-Week Plan)

### **Week 1-2: Foundation & Service Discovery**
**Spring Cloud Components**: Eureka Server, Eureka Client

**Business Scenario**: Setting up core services that need to find each other dynamically

**Hands-on Project**: 
- Create Eureka Server (Service Registry)
- Build 3 core services:
  - `user-service` (user management, authentication)
  - `product-service` (product catalog, search)
  - `order-service` (order processing, cart management)

**Specific Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up Eureka Server on port 8761
- [ ] Register all services with Eureka
- [ ] Implement health checks for each service
- [ ] Create service-to-service communication (user-service ‚Üí product-service)
- [ ] Test service discovery with multiple instances

**Real-world Learning**: Simulate vendor onboarding where new product services automatically register

---

### **Week 3: API Gateway & Routing**
**Spring Cloud Components**: Spring Cloud Gateway

**Business Scenario**: Single entry point for mobile app, web frontend, and partner APIs

**Hands-on Project**:
- Implement API Gateway as the single entry point
- Route requests to appropriate microservices
- Add rate limiting for different user tiers (premium vs. regular customers)

**Specific Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up Spring Cloud Gateway on port 8080
- [ ] Configure routing rules:
  - `/api/users/**` ‚Üí user-service
  - `/api/products/**` ‚Üí product-service  
  - `/api/orders/**` ‚Üí order-service
- [ ] Implement custom filters for request logging
- [ ] Add rate limiting (100 req/min for regular, 1000 req/min for premium)
- [ ] Set up CORS for web frontend

**Real-world Learning**: Handle traffic spikes during flash sales with intelligent routing

---

### **Week 4: Load Balancing & Client-Side Discovery**
**Spring Cloud Components**: Spring Cloud LoadBalancer, OpenFeign

**Business Scenario**: Distribute load across multiple instances during high traffic

**Hands-on Project**:
- Scale services horizontally
- Implement client-side load balancing
- Add Feign clients for clean service-to-service communication

**Specific Tasks**:
- [ ] Configure multiple instances of product-service (ports 8081, 8082, 8083)
- [ ] Implement custom load balancing strategy for product search
- [ ] Create Feign client in order-service to call product-service
- [ ] Add retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Implement custom load balancer for vendor-specific routing

**Real-world Learning**: Handle vendor-specific product queries efficiently

---

### **Week 5: Configuration Management**
**Spring Cloud Components**: Spring Cloud Config Server, Config Client

**Business Scenario**: Manage configurations across environments (dev, staging, prod) and feature toggles

**Hands-on Project**:
- Centralize configuration management
- Implement feature toggles for new marketplace features
- Manage environment-specific settings

**Specific Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up Config Server with Git backend
- [ ] Move all application.yml to centralized config repo
- [ ] Implement feature toggles:
  - `feature.recommendations.enabled`
  - `feature.realtime-inventory.enabled`
  - `feature.multi-currency.enabled`
- [ ] Configure different payment gateways per environment
- [ ] Add configuration refresh without restart (@RefreshScope)

**Real-world Learning**: Deploy new features gradually with feature toggles

---

### **Week 6: Circuit Breaker & Resilience**
**Spring Cloud Components**: Spring Cloud Circuit Breaker (Resilience4j)

**Business Scenario**: Handle payment service outages and external API failures gracefully

**Hands-on Project**:
- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Add fallback mechanisms for critical user journeys
- Monitor and alert on circuit breaker state changes

**Specific Tasks**:
- [ ] Add circuit breaker to payment-service calls
- [ ] Implement fallback for product recommendations (show popular items)
- [ ] Configure bulkhead pattern for different operation types
- [ ] Add retry mechanism for inventory updates
- [ ] Implement timeout configurations for external APIs
- [ ] Create health indicators for circuit breaker states

**Real-world Learning**: Ensure checkout process works even when recommendation service fails

---

### **Week 7: Distributed Tracing & Monitoring**
**Spring Cloud Components**: Spring Cloud Sleuth, Micrometer

**Business Scenario**: Debug performance issues across the order fulfillment workflow

**Hands-on Project**:
- Implement distributed tracing
- Add custom metrics for business KPIs
- Set up monitoring dashboards

**Specific Tasks**:
- [ ] Add Spring Cloud Sleuth to all services
- [ ] Configure Zipkin for trace visualization
- [ ] Implement custom metrics:
  - Order completion rate
  - Average product search time
  - Payment processing duration
- [ ] Add correlation IDs for order tracking
- [ ] Set up Micrometer with Prometheus
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboards for business metrics

**Real-world Learning**: Track user journey from product search to order completion

---

### **Week 8: Security & Advanced Patterns**
**Spring Cloud Components**: Spring Cloud Security, Spring Cloud Stream

**Business Scenario**: Secure multi-tenant marketplace with real-time notifications

**Hands-on Project**:
- Implement OAuth2 security across services
- Add event-driven architecture for real-time updates
- Deploy to cloud environment

**Specific Tasks**:
- [ ] Set up OAuth2 authorization server
- [ ] Implement JWT token propagation between services
- [ ] Add role-based access (CUSTOMER, VENDOR, ADMIN)
- [ ] Implement Spring Cloud Stream for order events
- [ ] Create event-driven inventory updates
- [ ] Add message queues (RabbitMQ) for order processing
- [ ] Deploy entire system to AWS/Azure using Docker

**Real-world Learning**: Handle multi-vendor permissions and real-time inventory sync
